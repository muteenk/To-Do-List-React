# This is TO-DO List Project in react js

I used React to create a cool and responsive todos list.

=> You can Create a To-do

=> You can Update a already existing To-do

=> You can Delete your To-do(s)

=> Also your To-Dos will be saved in your browsers local storage, so that even after closing your browser it won't be deleted automatically
